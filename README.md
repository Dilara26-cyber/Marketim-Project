I used Redux for state management, I could say it still confuses me a little bit.
For styling I used mostly styled components but styling pegination I used good old regular CSS.
Product and brand data comes from JSON Server. 
I used React Peginate for pegination, I fixed number of pages to 20 to match the design.
